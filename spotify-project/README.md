## Spotify Project (in progress)

##About

This uses the spotify API, clientID, clientSecret, AuthToken to provide the user with data. I used a tutorial for obtianing the AuthToken, but it's smooth sailing now

npm install
npm start

##Will add a feature to add playlists/edit playlists in the near future!!!
